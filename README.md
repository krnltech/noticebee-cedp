## All events to listen

### Update Board

By listening to an event called "updateBoard", returns a parameter called board with boardid in it. If the board matches with the client board id, reload all the assets.

```json
{
  "board": "617146c0180089449dc76d20" //string
}
```

By listening to an event called "sendScreenshot", take a screenshot, upload to the object storage server and then an url will be returned. Use this url and emit it back to the server along with the date, time and board id with the event "currentScreenShot" as a json. This "sendScreenshot" event also returns a board id in json to identify which board should send screenshots.

```json
{
  "time": "time and date string", //string
  "board": "617146c0180089449dc76d20" //string
}
